    <p class="paragraphs"> I feel at home in the world
      when I am swimming, playing piano
      and discussing music and literature with my brother.
      And I love to cook for my wonderful friends!

        <h3> What has drawn you to coding? </h3>
        <p class="paragraphs"> I am generally unsatisfied if
          I feel I only have a surface level understanding of a process
          or mechanism. 
          I have a deep desire to understand <i>how</i> things around me function. 
          Whether it's something I feel relates to me immediately 
          - like a biological process,  
          the breaks on my road bike, a new weird sound on a modular synthesiser
           or the dynamics of historical transition between epochs.
          I have a keen pleasure for getting to the fundamentals
          of what drives the processes that occur around me 
          and I always have fun doing it! Coding presents an exciting way for me
          to help shape the world around me and contribute to something
          bigger than myself.   </p>

    <h3> What do you hope for from the course? </h3>
    <p class="paragraphs"> I hope to feel immersed in a learning
      community. I've taken up a few hobbies and interests
      since graduating and having time without work (following
      a serious spinal injury), but
      it can be less gratifying without having a reciprocal social 
      and formal environment.
      Learning a complex new skill like coding or a language requires 
      a consistent learning routine and environment and I feel the full-time schedule will satisfy
      the immersion I think is so crucial for this kind of learning. 
      The other equally important thing that I am excited by is cultural element involved. 
      I look forward to being around other
      people who are learning alongside me and learning from educators who 
      are passionate about their craft. 
      I hope to be equipped with the skills I need to be capable of
      creating programs or components of programs that can concretely
      contribute something to the goings on of the world - in a professional
      setting but also a social setting.

    <h3> What do you hope to do after the course? </h3>
    <p class="paragraphs"> SO MUCH! I'm here because I have an 
      amazing opportunity from MYOB to develop a new skill set. 
      I hope to become part of a team that values a culture of education
      and has shown concrete leadership in adressing the barriers that
      exist in regards to women pursuing a pathway in tech. I identify 
      strongly with the values underpinning the developher program 
      and if I am succesful and do have a role at MYOB I would hope
      in the next 5 years I could play a role
      helping to facilitate the program. </p>
