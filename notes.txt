I had no problems with the admission challenge and finished it Wednesday night
after work in one sitting - BUT boy oh boy did I
create many problems for myself by deciding to include some additional styling
(PLEASE ENJOY THE CHICKEN).

After completing part #E I decided I wanted to make some small changes. 

edit 1) (in HTML)
I noticed the <title> tag read "title" and the only place "title" apeared
was the tab - so I changed it to my name.  

edit 2)  (in HTML)
Then I wanted an icon. I found a minion on a computer because I like them
and saved this.
for instructions: google returned this:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4888377/how-to-add-a-browser-tab-icon-favicon-for-a-website
and so I included " <link rel="icon" href="./img/favicon.png"> " in the <head>

edit 3) (in CSS)
regarding paragraph 1, 2 etc.. instead of having individual classes for each paragraph I decided to 
create a class 'paragraphs' beacuse in this instance they were all being rendered/treated
the same way.

edit 4) in CSS
changed margin to auto because I thought it looked nice centered. I also just wanted
to see what changing it did.

edit 5) in HTML
GitHub hyperlink. Because I was asked to make a GitHub I thought I'd link to it!
This was an easy thing to find on google.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18566608/how-do-i-add-an-a-link-to-an-icon-in-bootstrap
The answers to this persons questions helped me figure out how to do this and below is
the section from the <body> section in my HTML.

This also involved downloading an appropriate icon. Initially I had one that had a solid
background which I didn't like. I downloaded some that said they were 'transparent' but
these failed. I downloaded 'GIMP-2.10' and followed directions on how to delete the 
background and create an 'alpha channel', saved and export it as a png file. This was a
bit of fiddling but didn't take too long. Below is the <a> section with hyperlink and icon.
lines 14-17.


        <a href="https://github.com/GorginZ" target="_blank">       
        <img src="./img/github_icon.png" alt="My GitHub"
        width="53.5" height="51.5">
        </a>  
    
Edit 6 )
line 21 in the CSS
introduced margin styling (-6). I reduced margin between my name (<h2> section) and the
GitHub hyperlink to visually pair my name/title and the icon
 and put some distance between the rest of the text.

edit 7) in HTML
This isn't a stylistic edit but the one frustrating and ongoing problem I had 
(or decided to have) with the rendering generated by the instructed code - and I spent
hours trying to resolve this (and did in the end). 
I found that when I refreshed my browser, there was a flicker/jumping of the text. 
I spent ages (hours) changing different things
to try and find the cause of this. I thought it may have been a conflict between the previously
mentioned change in the CSS margin (edit 6 and edit 4), but reversing these edits 
didn't do anything. I changed heaps of things and after a while I gave up and 
returned to it again the next day.
I thought it was something I had added in my obsession
to excessively stylise my page that caused this 'font flicker' (a friend told me there's a 
term for this issue). I had assumed
because only content BELOW the name title (h2) section moved that it was the CSS style
changes mentioned above causing the issue, however, then I tried to think -what is another component 
that is different between the paragraphs and the titles? The titles below the first paragarph
would of course be effected even if it was something in the paragraphs because it would change the
formating/ how it all fits together anyway.
so I started looking in the HTML in the paragraph class. I noticed a line from the
 font url that said 'display=swap' and I deleted this section
of the url - fixed!!!!

I'd like to note - this 'font flicker' only occured in google chrome, but not in firefox. 
I wonder why? 
  the offending URL:

https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Cormorant+Garamond&display=swap" 

I was really pleased that I fixed this because 1) I thought I'd caused this by being
excessively creative and so it was a relief to learn it wasn't my flare
2) I asked my partner who has done coding before and he couldn't figure it out despite me
mentioning it over two days ( and having plenty of time to think about it ) I was very
satisfied when I was able to spot the 'disaplay=swap' and identify that it was the cause.


edit 8) CSS -Not so much a problem - just something I wondered about.
The div seemed to not form any function after the styling I was instructed to remove was removed.
it aligns the text left, but when I delete it - the text aligns left anyway.
I applied the div to the whole HTML anyway, to be consistent but wonder what the point is
- if I understand correctly, it exists to treat a section that it contains
of the HTML differently and these instructions go into the CSS.

edit 9) HTML - the chicken. Blood sweat and tears went into this chicken.
I had previously been playing with Khan Academy's free online intro to 
animation. In one of the challenges I animated a chicken which had a changing
X axis and it's head got big. I re-wrote the code so that:
1) the head would now move independently of the body on all X/Y inputs
2) remove all hard numbers and lazy half variable/half hard number stuff I initially had
3) make it so the animation only moved to a certain point (peck) 
ie - not have head float away forever
4) ok nice wow great bit time consuming considering this isn't part of the task
but I fixed my chicken
5) wrong. the background/canvas it was on was 400/400 and to make it an appropriate size
on the site (to match the GitHub icon) meant the chicken was not on the canvas.
6)re-do all of the maths and fix the scaling and then re-size the chicken in proportion to 
new canvas size.
7)find how to loop it, and this took most of today (sunday) but I'm happy enough
with where it is now - and realise it's strange to spend 3 days re-working a chicken animation
when it's not really the aim of the project but I really did not want to give up
on something I had already spent the better half of two days fiddling with.
8) - important learn I was betrayed by khan academy - the javascript in khan academy
 is "not real" (for lack of a better term) javascript. It has hidden functions 
 and other stuff that meant I couldn't just take my chicken over to my HTML. I had
  to find and steal Khan academy's html template thing to 
inclose my khan academy javascript in for it to run in this html. this ALSO meant
I had to re-work some viariables, but I don't know why but for some reason 
there I was re-calculating the beak's relationship to everythign else. 


Chickens are my favourite pet - I grew up with chooks and I wanted the chook to peck
my GitHub hyperlink :) This obviously involved a huge amount of much going back 
and forth and it was very frustrating to have to throw a few things out that 
aaalmost worked - eg multiple times having to re-size and do the maths again 
for how the variables act on certain other variables was killer, BUT I learnt
a lot about variables and spending many, many hours trouble-shooting this chicken
actually meant I felt SO much more aquainted with the CSS and HTML more broadly - because
rather than leaving it sans chicken and submitting I ended up 
continously having to check if it fit in/ actually ran and I kept accidently
deleting other things in the HTML/CSS and had to put them in again...so I was constantly 
looking at my code and trying to understand how it all fits in together. 
So I feel justified in spending this huge amount of time trying to troubleshoot my
chicken in even if it seems strange to not just submit after completing the requirements.

edit 10) CSS
I also added text shaddow on the titles but this looked really ugly and like a website
that was 'out of touch' with what's cool.
I removed this edit but it was: 
" text-shadow: 4px 4px 4px rgb(62, 6, 85); "

? Instructions say to delete h1 and I wondered in another context would I re-name the Headers?
Just because I know that I would be confused if something started at number 2 or 3.

Edit 11) 
Added in a hyperlink to a Youtube video of Glenn Gould playing
Bach's prelude in C. 
Process was the same as adding in my GitHub hyperlink.
I have been playing this lately and as mentioned I love to play Piano.
